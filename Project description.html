								<h3>1.TOPIC</h3>
							<p>Our team has opted to further expand on the function of our Cyber Security. In order to create a safety connection into the internet where people can freely communicate and interact with one another without concerning of the privacy. Humans' propensity for dishonesty is a primary cause of security vulnerabilities. Due to this vulnerability, hackers can trick their victims into clicking on malicious links, allowing them to download malware or provide them with personal information.</p>
							<p>Prior study has investigated the sensitivity of people to large-scale phishing efforts and narrowly focused spear-phishing assaults. This study examines how phishing emails delivered to particular groups affect their vulnerability to exploitation. We investigated whether the structure and content of email communications affected recipients' susceptibility to phishing. The objective of the phishing emails was to elicit either the fear of losing important assets (such as enrollment and aid) or the hope of getting valuable assets (such as enrollment and aid) (e.g., iPad, gift card, social networks).<p>
							<p>The objective of our communications was the contextual exploitation of human weaknesses such as greed, social necessity, etc. Emails were sent to 7225 students, and their responses were recorded. According to the study, phishing was more likely to succeed when emails were tailored to target the psychological weaknesses of receivers. When individuals fear losing something of value or are eager to acquire something of value, phishing and deception are more likely to occur. As a result of our research, a theoretical framework based on the heuristic-systematic processing model has been developed to evaluate the susceptibility of individuals to deception. Using our experiment, we illustrate that several factors impact phishing campaigns. <p>

								<h3>2. Motivation</h3>
								<p>Many of the protocols that make up the Internet's current architecture were established without any regard for security. In the absence of a truly secure architecture, protecting a network becomes increasingly challenging. As a result, the Internet is a constantly changing environment, both in terms of its structure and the technologies that are being developed. Many Internet attacks can be quickly, cheaply, and difficult to detect and track because of its openness and the original design of the protocols. An attacker does not need to be present in order to carry out an attack. A wide variety of cyberattacks can be launched from virtually any point on Earth, making it impossible to determine the identity of the perpetrator. It is not always necessary to "break in" to a website's data or service to undermine its confidentiality, integrity, or accessibility (get privileges on it). <p>
								<p>Despite this, a disproportionate number of websites rely on the Internet for their entire operation. When it comes to trusting the Internet, it is common for websites to be naive or reckless. Data and system dangers may go unnoticed by these individuals. Even if the current security measures are adequate, they may feel their website will not be a target. Over time, solutions become less effective as new tools and techniques are developed by invaders and technology advances. The rapid expansion and use of the network, as well as the rapid implementation of network services involving complex applications, both increase the vulnerability of the Internet. In many cases, these services are not designed to be secure in any way. They rush to get new items out the door without checking for earlier mistakes or new security flaws that could be introduced. <p>
								<p>Because operating system security is rarely taken into account when acquiring a new computer, the problem gets worse. For commercial operating system suppliers, client demand for performance, pricing, usability and maintenance and support are the most important factors in their sales. Operating systems available for purchase are, as a result, shipped in an unprotected state, allowing sites to begin using them right away. These servers/websites are frequently not set up correctly from a security aspect prior to joining. They are subject to attacks that can begin within minutes of connection because of their unsecure architecture. </p>
